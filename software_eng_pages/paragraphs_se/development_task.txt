User Authentication Feature

Objective:
Develop a user authentication feature for a web application to ensure secure access to user accounts.

Form validation is done to ensure that user input meets the required criteria. This step helps prevent invalid data from being submitted, enhancing the overall security and usability of the authentication process.

Implement password hashing to securely store user passwords in the database. Hashing ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

Develop the functionality for users to create new accounts. This involves capturing user information, validating it using the previously implemented form validation, and securely storing the user's credentials after hashing the password.

Enable users to log in to their accounts using their credentials. This step involves validating the user's input against the stored credentials in the database. If the credentials match, grant access to the user's account.

Session management is done to maintain user authentication across multiple pages or sessions. This includes creating and managing user sessions, handling session expiration, and securely managing session data.
