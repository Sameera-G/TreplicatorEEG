# EEG-Based Mental Workload Assessment Tools for Software Engineers

This repository provides custom-built data collection tools developed to assess mental workload (MWL) in software engineers. The framework integrates **task simulations**, **self-reported assessments (NASA-TLX)**, and **EEG signal monitoring**, ensuring a dual-source workload evaluation. It follows a **Design Science Research (DSR)** methodology for iterative development and validation.

## Project Title

**Development and Evaluation of Custom Data Collection Tools for Mental Workload Assessment in Software Engineers: A Design Science Research Approach**

## Tools Developed

### 1. Task Simulation Desktop Application (TSDA)
Simulates real-world software engineering tasks to collect performance-related data such as:
- Task accuracy
- Completion time
- EEG signal synchronization

🔗 [TSDA Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Sameera-G/TreplicatorEEG)

### 2. Self-Reporting Mobile Application (SRMA)
Records self-reported MWL values using NASA-TLX after each simulated task.
