# EEG-Based Mental Workload Assessment Tools for Software Engineers

This repository provides custom-built data collection tools developed to assess mental workload (MWL) in software engineers. The framework integrates **task simulations**, **self-reported assessments (NASA-TLX)**, and **EEG signal monitoring**, ensuring a dual-source workload evaluation. It follows a **Design Science Research (DSR)** methodology for iterative development and validation.

## Project Title

**Development and Evaluation of Custom Data Collection Tools for Mental Workload Assessment in Software Engineers: A Design Science Research Approach**

## Abstract
Mental workload (MWL) assessment is crucial in high-cognitive-demand professions such as software engineering, where mental strain impacts productivity, accuracy, and well-being. Traditional MWL assessment methods, which are based solely on subjective self-reports or physiological signals alone, often lack reliability, real-world applicability, or comprehensive validation. This study introduces a custom-built data collection framework tailored for software engineers, integrating a Task Simulation Desktop Application (TSDA) and a Self-Reporting Mobile Application (SRMA). The TSDA replicates real-world software engineering tasks, while the SRMA collects self-reported workload levels (NASA-TLX) alongside objective electroencephalography (EEG) signals.

The research follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, ensuring iterative development, usability testing, and refinement of the tools based on software engineer feedback. A structured pilot test phase evaluated the effectiveness of the system, leading to improved usability, data synchronization, and reliability. The results demonstrate that the tools developed provide a structured and scalable MWL data collection framework, allowing dual-source workload assessment through synchronized EEG-based physiological monitoring and subjective reporting. Although this study focuses on tool development, future research will employ machine learning-based workload analysis to automate MWL classification, improve real-time workload prediction, and improve adaptive cognitive load management in software engineering workflows. The integration of EEG signals along with task simulations performance and NASA-TLX self-reports provides a dual-validation mechanism, which lays the groundwork for AI-driven cognitive workload prediction models aimed at optimizing task allocation and well-being of Software Engineers.

## Methodology

The tools were developed using the **Design Science Research (DSR)** method, consisting of:
- **Relevance Cycle**: Identifying needs and task characteristics
- **Design Cycle**: Gathering requirements and building artifacts
- **Rigor Cycle**: Ensuring scientific validity and alignment with EEG + NASA-TLX standards
- **Evaluation Cycle**: Pilot testing, usability improvements, and validation

 **EEG Band Focus**:
- Theta (4‚Äì8 Hz): Mental effort  
- Alpha (8‚Äì12 Hz): Inverse workload indicator  
- Beta (13‚Äì30 Hz): Active attention
